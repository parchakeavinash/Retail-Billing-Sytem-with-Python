# Retail Billing System using Python and Tkinter GUI

This project implements a simple Retail Billing System with a graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Python using the Tkinter library. The application allows users to generate bills for retail purchases in different categories, such as cosmetics, groceries, and cold drinks

## User-Friendly Interface: The Tkinter GUI provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for entering customer details and product quantities.

## Product Categories: The system supports three main product categories: cosmetics, groceries, and cold drinks. Users can input quantities for specific items in each category.

## Calculation of Total Bill: The application dynamically calculates the total bill based on the entered quantities and item prices. It includes tax calculations for cosmetics, groceries, and cold drinks.

## Bill Management: Users can save generated bills, search for bills using a bill number, and print existing bills.

## Email Integration: The system allows users to send the generated bill as an email, providing a convenient way to share bills with customers.

## Responsive Design: The GUI is designed with responsive elements for a seamless user experience

# Usage:

## Run the script to launch the GUI.
## Enter customer details, select products, and input quantities.
## Click the "Generate Bill" button to view and save the bill.
## Additional features include searching for bills, printing bills, and sending bills via emai

## This Retail Billing System serves as a foundation for a small-scale billing application and can be extended for further customization and integration with databases for more advanced functionalities.
